# PMAN UI

Everything you need to run a PMAN setup in the lab.

## Defining your instruments

The default view is the "instruments" view. This allows you to define the setup you are using, as well as view some summary status information about the instruments.

## Getting the servers

Any necessary instrument servers are in the 'repos' directory, which can be populated by the scripts in the 'scripts' directory
